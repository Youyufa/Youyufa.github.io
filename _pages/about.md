<!-- Introduction -->

<div class="col text-justify p-0">
  I am a Motion Planning Engineer of BYD Ltd. Autonomous Driving Unit, where we are developing a new generation of APA(Automated Parking Assistance), whicle called \(e^4\)APA. I lead the design and development of the parallel slot planner. I am also charged in longitudal planning, parking decision, data interface, algorithm architecture, CI&CD and data analyse.
  <br/><br/>
  Previously, I was a Research & Develop Intern at Momenta.ai, where I participated in the design and development of the world model and new planner for MPilot, which is supplied to Mercedes-Benz and Toyota. 
  <br/><br/>
  Prior to that, I was a Master student in the Control of the <a href="https://www.scs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> at Harbin Institute of Technology. My advisor was Linhui Zhao and I worked on motion planning for on-road and openspace environment. My PhD thesis on Motion Planning can be found <a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/thesis/thesis.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">here</a>. Throughout my PhD I also worked on <a href="{{ '/projects/' }}">multiple other projects</a> related to roboticsï¼Œ planning and control.
  <br/><br/>
  Before I joined HIT, I graduated with a Bachelor in Automation from Dalian Maritime University. I have been awarded the Scholarship for Outstanding Students and the Scholarship for Technological Innovation, and also won an award in the NXP Cup Intelligent Car Race 2019.
